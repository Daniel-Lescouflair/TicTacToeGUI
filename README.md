# TicTacToeGUI
First stab at a fully working WPF application using Tic Tac Toe

Purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my practices by making a Tic Tac Toe application game. In order to run the application
you would need to have a .NET framework installed in order to launch the application, being a Windows application. Steps to run the
exe.

1. Navigate to TicTacToeGUI/TicTacToeWpf/bin/Debug.
2. Download the TicTacToeWpfe.exe
3. Double click the exe.
4. Try the game out for yourself!

If you would like to see the code you can navigate to TicTacToeGUI/TicTacToeWpf and see the GUI by looking at the
<b>MainWindow.xaml</b> and the code behind the scenes by looking at <b>MainWindow.xaml.cs</b>.

Any other questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to ask.
